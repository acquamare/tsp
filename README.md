# Travelling Salesman Problem

**Hello!** So this is an optimization problem I've thought about in the past... this is a simple implementation in 2D space using the Cartesian plane. Basically, put in the points you want to go to in the text file, and the ruby scripts will print out all the possible routes and their distances.

Each line should have its own point.The format of each point should be as follows: point_label,x-coordinate,y-coordinate

The thing you should work on is polishing the output. There will always be duplicates, because reversing a route would yield the same distance. You could also try to sort the data using a CSV program like Excel.

Alright, I think that's about it.
